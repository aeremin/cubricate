On next (and I hope, last) repository reset:
* Find a good name for the project   (variants: Voxeland)
* Switch file name pattern to camelCase
* Refactor code to new style: no spaces before empty braces
* Rename ``build'' to ``build-debug''

Bugs:
* Exclude the rest of GLTools from project
* Restore GL_MAP_READ_BIT in GLWidget::lockCubes

Improvements:
* Find or write a logging system (with message ranking: information, warning, error, etc.)
